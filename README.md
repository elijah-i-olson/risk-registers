# 📊 Risk Registers

This repository contains sample risk register templates aligned to industry-standard frameworks such as **NIST 800-30** and **ISO 27005**. Each example is designed to help organizations and learners document and prioritize risk using clear, structured methodologies.

These resources showcase how to identify assets, assess vulnerabilities, score risk, and propose relevant control strategies—all while aligning to governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) practices.
