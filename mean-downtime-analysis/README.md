# ⏱️ Mean Down Time (MDT) Analysis

This project provides a downtime recovery estimate for key operational processes, evaluating the acceptable thresholds for recovery using **MTD (Maximum Tolerable Downtime)**, **RTO (Recovery Time Objective)**, and **RPO (Recovery Point Objective)**. The data supports business continuity planning in a regulated, agriculture-focused environment.

## 📘 Project Overview

Each business function was analyzed to determine how long the operation could be disrupted before business continuity, compliance, or safety would be impacted. The final deliverable supports operational resilience efforts by mapping:

- **MTD** – The longest acceptable delay before irreparable impact occurs  
- **RTO** – The maximum time allowable to restore service  
- **RPO** – The maximum data loss tolerable in hours
